## Objectives 
* Project uses analysis to answer 3 big picture questions:
* Which variables have the strongest impact on a successful customer transaction (Revenue column)?
* Are there any definitive clusters between the ExitRate and BounceRate columns? If so, are there any outliers? 
* Are there any methods to reduce the dimensionality of the continuous variables in your data set? If so, which method, how can you tell, and how many variables do you need to retain 80% of the original variance?
